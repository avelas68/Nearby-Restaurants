# Nearby-Restaurants
With the help of my group members Danny, Julie, Maria, and I, we created an android app that is able to locate restaurants of the
users choosing. The app helps filter out just what type of food they are in looking for, such as: Mexican, Italian, and Vietnamese.
The app also helps the user decide how far they want the resteraunt to be and how costly they are willing to pay for their meal.
My brilliant team member Julie set up and coded the google maps API onto the android app while my other talented teammate Danny
coded the list in which the user is able to see in a list view what restaurants matched the user's criteria. I helped code the menu
in which the users can filter out the type of restaurant they would like to eat at. This was coded in java using Android Studio.
